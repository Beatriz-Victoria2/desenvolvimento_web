      Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <em>It has roots in a piece of
      classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</em>
      Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
      Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from
      a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
      classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
      from sections  <small> 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" </small> (The
      Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
      treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
      first line of <u> Lorem Ipsum,</u> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
      line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the
      1500s is reproduced below for those interested. <sub>Sections 1.10.32 and
      1.10.33 from </sub>"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
      in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the
      1914 translation by <del>H. Rackham.</del>
